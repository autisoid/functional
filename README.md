# functional
 Heavily vectorized C++17 two header lightweight library without any dependencies like CRT, Windows API, STL and others. Our library is for allocating memory (Be careful: our allocator is static: the mem pool is allocated for all the program lifecycle), sprintf and some other overhead. Currently sprintf supports such format specifiers: %u, %i, %d, %f (no custom precision), %c, %x, %X, %p, %s, %o. Known bugs of sprintf: two format specifiers can't stand near each other: %d%s, %f%X &c
